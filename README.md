a. Say something about yourself

    My name is Justin Kim and I am a full-time graduate student at Northeastern for Bioinformatics. My background is in Microbiology so my programming experience is limited to coursework and self-study over the past year. I primarily work in Perl, Python and R for coding. I'd like to learn web development skills to better grasp and utilize web tools that are increasingly being leveraged for data analysis purposes.
  
b. Describe the purpose of repository, e.g., for webdev
    - Web development repository

c. Create links to the following
  i.    Root to the hosted environment on Heroku (or AWS, or OpenShift)
            https://git.heroku.com/kim-justin-webdev.git

  ii.   Link to your project (you might need to come back to this) 
  iii.  Link to your assignment (you might need to come back to this)
